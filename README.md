EasyMineLauncher2
=================

This project aims to provide an EasyMineLauncher like functionality.
EasyMineLauncher does not work with the versions of Minecraft 1.6 and above,
so this project aims to provide the launcher starting with these versions.


Will this project ever be started?
==================================

After looking at the official launcher, I just realized that it does implement
*a lot* of the functionality I provided with EML. Other functionality is now
hidden within Minecraft itself (window location, properties etc.). With
the new launcher it now seems easily possible to create a portable launcher and
Minecraft installation and manage multiple versions, one of the two main goals
of EML.

The other main goal was to provide an easy way to play offline, this does
not seem to be provided with the official launcher.

At least the last part might be worth writing again, but there's a lot of
changed infrastructure around Minecraft right now, which needs to be figured
out and written.

Don't expect something here soon...sorry...
