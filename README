EasyMineLauncher2
=================

This project aims to provide an EasyMineLauncher like functionality.
EasyMineLauncher does not work with the versions of Minecraft 1.6 and above,
so this project aims to provide the launcher starting with these versions.


Will this project ever be started?
==================================

It just did get started, actually. MinecraftMiddleKnife, the library behind this
launcher, is finished in my opinion. Everything is in place to create this
launcher and I can actually start Minecraft with it.

So...I'll see to it that it gets done.
